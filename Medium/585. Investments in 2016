Write an SQL query to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:

have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and
are not located in the same city like any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).
Round tiv_2016 to two decimal places.


SELECT ROUND(SUM(TIV_2016),2) AS TIV_2016
FROM
(SELECT *,
COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY TIV_2015) AS CNT1,
COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY LAT, LON) AS CNT2
FROM INSURANCE)AS TBL
WHERE CNT1 > =2 AND CNT2 =1
