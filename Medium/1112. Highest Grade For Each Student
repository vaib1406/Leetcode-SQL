Write a SQL query to find the highest grade with its corresponding course for each student. In case of a tie, you should find the course with the smallest course_id.

Return the result table ordered by student_id in ascending order.


with cte as
(select student_id,course_id, grade, dense_rank() over (partition by student_id order by grade desc, course_id)dr from Enrollments)

select student_id,course_id, grade from cte
where dr = 1
