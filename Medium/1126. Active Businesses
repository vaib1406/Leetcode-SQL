The average activity for a particular event_type is the average occurences across all companies that have this event.

An active business is a business that has more than one event_type such that their occurences is strictly greater than the average activity for that event.

Write an SQL query to find all active businesses.


WITH r2 AS(
SELECT *, CASE WHEN occurences > AVG(occurences) OVER (PARTITION BY event_type) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS chosen
FROM Events)
SELECT business_id
FROM r2
GROUP BY business_id
HAVING SUM(chosen) >1;
