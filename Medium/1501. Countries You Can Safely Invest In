(select left(phone_number, charindex('-', phone_number)-1)country_code, duration from calls ca
join person p on ca.caller_id = p.id or ca.callee_id = p.id)

,cte1 as
(select co.name, avg(duration) over (partition by co.name)avg_duration from cte ct
join country co on ct.country_code = co.country_code)

select distinct name as country  from cte1
where avg_duration> (select avg(duration)global_avg_duration from person p
                      join calls c on p.id = c.caller_id or p.id = c.callee_id)
