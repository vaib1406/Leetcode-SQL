Write an SQL query to find for each month and country: the number of approved transactions and their total amount, the number of chargebacks, and their total amount.

Note: In your query, given the month and country, ignore rows with all zeros.


with cte as(
    select * from transactions WHERE state = 'approved'
    union all
    select trans_id as id, tns.country as country, 'back' as state, 
    tns.amount as amount, cb.trans_date as trans_date
    from Chargebacks cb join Transactions tns on 
    cb.trans_id = tns.id
)
select distinct left(trans_date, 7) as month, country, 
sum(case when state='approved' then 1 else 0 end) as approved_count,
sum(case when state='approved' then amount else 0 end) as approved_amount,
sum(case when state='back' then 1 else 0 end) as chargeback_count,
sum(case when state='back' then amount else 0 end) as chargeback_amount
from cte
group by left(trans_date, 7), country
order by left(trans_date, 7)
