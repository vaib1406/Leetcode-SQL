with cte as
(select contest_id,mail,name, (case when user_id in (gold_medal, silver_medal ,bronze_medal) then 1 else 0
end) as pp
from contests, users)

select distinct c1.name, c1.mail from cte c1
join cte c2 on c1.contest_id+ 1 = c2.contest_id and c1.mail = c2.mail
join cte c3 on c1.contest_id + 2 = c3.contest_id and c1.mail = c3.mail
where c1.pp + c2.pp = 2 and c1.pp+ c3.pp = 2
union 
select distinct name,mail from contests c
join users u on c.gold_medal = u.user_id
group by gold_medal,name, mail
having count(*)> =3
