Write an SQL query to report the number of bank accounts of each salary category. The salary categories are:

"Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
"Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
"High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, then report 0.

WITH cte AS (
SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Average Salary' AS category
UNION ALL
SELECT 'High Salary' AS category
)

SELECT
c.category, COALESCE(COUNT(a.account_id),0) AS accounts_count
FROM accounts a
RIGHT JOIN cte c
ON (CASE when a.income < 20000 THEN 'Low Salary'
WHEN a.income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000 THEN 'Average Salary'
WHEN a.income > 50000 THEN 'High Salary'
END
) = c.category
GROUP BY c.category
