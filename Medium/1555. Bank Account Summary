(select user_id, user_name, credit, sum(case when user_id = paid_by then -amount else amount end)new_amount from users u
left join transactions t on u.user_id = t.paid_by or u.user_id = t.paid_to
group by user_id, user_name, credit)

select user_id, user_name,isnull((credit+new_amount),credit)credit, (case when (credit+new_amount) <0 then 'Yes' else 'No' end)credit_limit_breached  from cte
