Write an SQL query to report the number of calls and the total call duration between each pair of distinct persons (person1, person2) where person1 < person2.


with cte as
(select *, sum(duration) over (partition by from_id * to_id)total_duration,
count(*) over (partition by from_id * to_id) call_count,
dense_rank() over (partition by from_id * to_id order by from_id)dr
 from calls)

select distinct from_id person1, to_id person2, call_count, total_duration  from cte 
where dr = 1
