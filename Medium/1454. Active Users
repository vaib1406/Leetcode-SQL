Active users are those who logged in to their accounts for five or more consecutive days.

Write an SQL query to find the id and the name of active users.

Return the result table ordered by id.


with cte as
(select *, dense_rank() over (partition by id order by login_date desc) as ranks
from logins)

select distinct c.id ,a.name from cte c
join accounts as a on c.id = a.id
group by c.id, a.name, dateadd(day,c.ranks,c.login_date)
having count( distinct c.login_date) >=5
order by id
