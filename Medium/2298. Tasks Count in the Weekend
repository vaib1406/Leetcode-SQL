the number of the tasks that were submitted during the weekend (Saturday, Sunday) as weekend_cnt, and
the number of the tasks that were submitted during the working days as working_cnt.



select count(case when datename(weekday, submit_date) in('Saturday' , 'Sunday') then 1
 end)weekend_cnt, 
  count(case when datename(weekday, submit_date) not in ('Saturday' , 'Sunday') then 1 end)working_cnt 
    from tasks
