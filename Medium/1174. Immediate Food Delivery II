If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.



with cte as
(select customer_id, min(order_date)order_date from delivery
group by customer_id)

select round(100*sum(case when c.order_date = d.customer_pref_delivery_date then 
       1 else 0 end)*1.0/count(*),2)immediate_percentage
       from cte c
          join Delivery d on c.customer_id = d.customer_id 
            and c.order_date = d.order_date
