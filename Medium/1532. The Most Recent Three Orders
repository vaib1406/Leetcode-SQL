Write an SQL query to find the most recent three orders of each user. If a user ordered less than three orders, return all of their orders.

Return the result table ordered by customer_name in ascending order and in case of a tie by the customer_id in ascending order. If there is still a tie, order them by order_date in descending order.


with cte as
(select name as customer_name, o.customer_id, order_id,
o.order_date, dense_rank() over (partition by o.customer_id order by order_date desc)dr from customers c
join orders o on c.customer_id = o.customer_id)

select customer_name, customer_id, order_id, order_date from cte c
where dr <=3
order by customer_name, c.customer_id, order_date desc
