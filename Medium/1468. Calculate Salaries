Write an SQL query to find the salaries of the employees after applying taxes. Round the salary to the nearest integer.

The tax rate is calculated for each company based on the following criteria:

0% If the max salary of any employee in the company is less than $1000.
24% If the max salary of any employee in the company is in the range [1000, 10000] inclusive.
49% If the max salary of any employee in the company is greater than $10000.


with cte as
(select *, 
     max(salary) over (partition by company_id order by salary desc)max_salary 
      from salaries)

,cte1 as
      (select company_id, employee_id, employee_name, salary, (salary-(case 
             when max_salary> 10000 then salary*0.49
             when max_salary between 1000 and 10000 then salary*0.24
             else salary
             end))res_salary        
        from cte)

        select company_id,employee_id,employee_name,
         round((case when (salary-res_salary) = salary then salary else res_salary end),0)salary 
          from cte1
