Write an SQL query to report the customer_id and customer_name of customers who bought products "A", "B" but did not buy the product "C" since we want to recommend them to purchase this product.

Return the result table ordered by customer_id.


WITH resultIDs AS
(
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING STRING_AGG(product_name, '') NOT LIKE '%C%' AND
          STRING_AGG(product_name, '') LIKE '%A%' AND
          STRING_AGG(product_name, '') LIKE '%B%'
)

SELECT r.customer_id, c.customer_name
FROM resultIDs AS r
INNER JOIN Customers AS c
    ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
