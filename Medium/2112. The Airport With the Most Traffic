with cte as
(select departure_airport,flights_count from flights
union all
select arrival_airport ,flights_count from flights)

, cte2 as
(select departure_airport ,sum(flights_count)total_flights from cte
group by departure_airport)

select  departure_airport  airport_id from cte2
where total_flights = (select max(total_flights) from cte2)
