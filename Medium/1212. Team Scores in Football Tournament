You would like to compute the scores of all teams after all matches. Points are awarded as follows:
A team receives three points if they win a match (i.e., Scored more goals than the opponent team).
A team receives one point if they draw a match (i.e., Scored the same number of goals as the opponent team).
A team receives no points if they lose a match (i.e., Scored fewer goals than the opponent team).
Write an SQL query that selects the team_id, team_name and num_points of each team in the tournament after all described matches.

Return the result table ordered by num_points in decreasing order. In case of a tie, order the records by team_id in increasing order.


select t.team_id, t.team_name,
sum(case when host_goals> guest_goals and t.team_id = m.host_team then 3
when host_goals < guest_goals and t.team_id = m.guest_team then 3
when host_goals = guest_goals then 1 
else 0 end)num_points
from teams t
left join matches m on t.team_id = m.host_team 
 or t.team_id = m.guest_team
 group by t.team_id, t.team_name
 order by num_points desc , t.team_id
