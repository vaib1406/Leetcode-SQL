Write an SQL query to report the name of the winning candidate (i.e., the candidate who got the largest number of votes).
The test cases are generated so that exactly one candidate wins the elections.

with cte as
(select name, count(*)vote from candidate c
join vote v on c.id = v.candidateId
group by name)

select name from cte
where vote = (select max(vote) from cte)
