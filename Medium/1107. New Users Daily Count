Write an SQL query to reports for every date within at most 90 days from today, the number of users that logged in for the first time on that date. Assume today is 2019-06-30.

WITH first_login AS(
SELECT user_id, MIN(activity_date) AS login_date
FROM Traffic
WHERE activity = 'login'
GROUP BY user_id)

SELECT login_date, COUNT(*) as user_count
FROM first_login
WHERE login_date >= DATEADD(day, -90, '2019-06-30')
GROUP BY login_date
