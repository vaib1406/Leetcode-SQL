Write an SQL query to report the number of experiments done on each of the three platforms for each of the three given experiments. 
Notice that all the pairs of (platform, experiment) should be included in the output including the pairs with zero experiments.



select pm platform, name experiment_name, count(experiment_id) num_experiments
from (values('Android'), ('IOS'), ('Web')) p(pm) cross join
(values('Reading'), ('Sports'), ('Programming')) e(name)
left join experiments on p.pm = platform and e.name = experiment_name
group by pm, name
