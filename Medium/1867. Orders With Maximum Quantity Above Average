You are running an e-commerce site that is looking for imbalanced orders. An imbalanced order is one whose maximum quantity is strictly greater than the average quantity of every order (including itself).

The average quantity of an order is calculated as (total quantity of all products in the order) / (number of different products in the order). The maximum quantity of an order is the highest quantity of any single product in the order.

Write an SQL query to find the order_id of all imbalanced orders.


with cte as
(select order_id, (sum(quantity)*1.0/count(distinct product_id))avg_quantity, max(quantity)max_quantity from ordersdetails 
group by order_id)


select order_id from cte 
where max_quantity > (select max(avg_quantity) from  cte)
