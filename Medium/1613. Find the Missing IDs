Write an SQL query to find the missing customer IDs. The missing IDs are ones that are not in the Customers table but are in the range between 1 and the maximum customer_id present in the table.

Notice that the maximum customer_id will not exceed 100.

Return the result table ordered by ids in ascending order.


with cte_a as
(
select max(customer_id) max_id from customers
)
,cte_b as
(
select 1 min_id from customers --anchor query
union all
select b.min_id + 1 from cte_a a inner join cte_b b on -- recursive query
b.min_id < a.max_id
)
select min_id as ids from cte_b
except
select customer_id from customers
