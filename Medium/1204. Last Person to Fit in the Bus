There is a queue of people waiting to board a bus. However, the bus has a weight limit of 1000 kilograms, so there may be some people who cannot board.

Write an SQL query to find the person_name of the last person that can fit on the bus without exceeding the weight limit. The test cases are generated such that the first person does not exceed the weight limit.


with cte as
(select *, sum(weight) over (order by turn asc)total_weight from queue)

select person_name from cte 
where total_weight = (select max(total_weight) from cte where total_weight <=1000)
