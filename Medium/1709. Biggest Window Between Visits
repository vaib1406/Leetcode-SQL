Assume today's date is '2021-1-1'.

Write an SQL query that will, for each user_id, find out the largest window of days between each visit and the one right after it (or today if you are considering the last visit).

Return the result table ordered by user_id.


with cte as
(select user_id, visit_date, isnull(lead(visit_date,1) over 
 (partition by user_id order by visit_date), '2021-01-01')next_visit_date from UserVisits)

 select user_id, max(datediff(day,visit_date, next_visit_date))biggest_window from cte
 group by user_id
 order by user_id
