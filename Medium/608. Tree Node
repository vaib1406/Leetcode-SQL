Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

"Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
"Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
"Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree.



Select
    id
,   case 
        when p_id is null then 'Root'
        when exists (Select p_id From Tree tr Where t.id=tr.p_ID) then 'Inner' else 'Leaf'
    end 'type'
From Tree t
Order By t.id asc;
