You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

Write an SQL query to compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.

Return result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.



SELECT  visited_on, 
         SUM(SUM(amount)) OVER(ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)AS'amount',
        ROUND(CAST(SUM(SUM(amount)) OVER(ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS FLOAT)/7.0 ,2) average_amount 
FROM    Customer 
GROUP BY visited_on
ORDER BY visited_on
offset 6 rows
