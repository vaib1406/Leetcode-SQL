The answer rate for a question is the number of times a user answered the question by the number of times a user showed the question.
Write an SQL query to report the question that has the highest answer rate. If multiple questions have the same maximum answer rate, report the question with the smallest question_id.

select Top 1 question_id as survey_log
from surveylog
group by question_id
order by count(answer_id) / nullif(sum(case when action='show' then 1 else 0 end),0) desc, count(answer_id) desc
