The winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total points within the group. In the case of a tie, the lowest player_id wins.

Write an SQL query to find the winner in each group.


WITH CTE AS
(SELECT first_player player_id, first_score score
FROM matches
UNION ALL
SELECT second_player player_id, second_score score
FROM matches)

,CTE_1 AS
(SELECT player_id, SUM(score) score
FROM CTE
GROUP BY player_id)

SELECT DISTINCT group_id ,FIRST_VALUE(c.player_id) OVER(partition by group_id ORDER BY score DESC, c.player_id) player_id
from cte_1 c LEFT JOIN players p ON c.player_id = p.player_id
