Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the users whose first and last calls on any day were with the same person. Calls are counted regardless of being the caller or the recipient.



with call_cte as
(SELECT caller_id, recipient_id, call_time FROM calls
 UNION ALL
SELECT recipient_id , caller_id, call_time FROM calls)

, call_rankings as
(SELECT
caller_id
, recipient_id
, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY caller_id, LEFT(call_time,11) ORDER BY call_time ASC) as rnk_first
, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY caller_id, LEFT(call_time,11) ORDER BY call_time DESC) as rnk_last
, LEFT(call_time,11) as day
FROM
call_cte)

SELECT DISTINCT
    caller_id as user_id
FROM
    call_rankings
WHERE
    rnk_first = 1
    OR
    rnk_last = 1
GROUP BY
    caller_id
    , day
HAVING
    COUNT(DISTINCT(recipient_id)) = 1
