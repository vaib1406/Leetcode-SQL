with cte as
(select 
item_category, datename(weekday, order_date)week_day, sum(quantity)total
from orders o 
right join items i on o.item_id = i.item_id
group by item_category, datename(weekday, order_date))

select item_category CATEGORY, max(case when week_day = 'Monday' then total else 0 end)MONDAY,
max(case when week_day = 'Tuesday' then total else 0 end)TUESDAY,
max(case when week_day = 'Wednesday' then total else 0 end)WEDNESDAY,
max(case when week_day = 'Thursday' then total else 0 end)THURSDAY,
max(case when week_day = 'Friday' then total else 0 end)FRIDAY,
max(case when week_day = 'Saturday' then total else 0 end)SATURDAY,
