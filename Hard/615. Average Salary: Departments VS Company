 Write an SQL query to report the comparison result (higher/lower/same) of the average salary of employees in a department to the company's average salary.

with avg_company_salary as
(select s.employee_id, department_id, amount, pay_date
  ,avg(amount) over (partition by pay_date)avg_company_salary
    from salary s
      join employee e on s.employee_id = e.employee_id)

,avg_dept_salary as
(select department_id, pay_date
 ,avg(amount) over 
  (partition by pay_date, department_id)avg_dept_salary,
    cast(avg_company_salary as float)avg_company_salary from avg_company_salary)

select distinct 
 concat(datepart(year, pay_date),'-', RIGHT(CONCAT('0', MONTH([pay_date])), 2))
 pay_month,  
  department_id,
  (case 
    when avg_dept_salary > avg_company_salary then 'higher'
     when avg_dept_salary < avg_company_salary then 'lower'
      else 'same' end)comparison
         from avg_dept_salary
