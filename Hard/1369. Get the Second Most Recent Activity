Write an SQL query to show the second most recent activity of each user.

If the user only has one activity, return that one. A user cannot perform more than one activity at the same time.


WITH myCTE as (
    SELECT username, activity, startDate, endDate
    , ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY username ORDER BY startDate) as activity_ordinal
    , COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY username) as total_activities
    FROM UserActivity
)
SELECT username, activity, startDate, endDate 
FROM myCTE 
WHERE activity_ordinal = 2 
OR total_activities = 1
