Write an SQL query to calculate the total time in minutes spent by each employee on each day at the office. 
Note that within one day, an employee can enter and leave more than once. The time spent in the office for a single entry is out_time - in_time.

with cte as
(select emp_id, event_day, sum(in_time) over (partition by emp_id,event_day)sum_in,
sum(out_time) over (partition by emp_id,event_day)sum_out
 from employees)

select distinct event_day day, emp_id, (sum_out - sum_in)total_time from cte
