Write an SQL query to find the average number of sessions per user for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively, 
rounded to 2 decimal places. The sessions we want to count for a user are those with at least one activity in that time period.

with cte as
(select count(distinct session_id)average_sessions_per_user from activity
where datediff(day, activity_date, '2019-07-27') <30
group by user_id
having count(activity_type)>=1)

select isnull(round(sum(average_sessions_per_user)*1.0 /count(average_sessions_per_user),2),0)
average_sessions_per_user
from cte
