Hot if the average weather_state is greater than or equal to 25, and
Warm otherwise:-

with cte as
(select country_name, (1.0 *sum(weather_state)/count(*))avg_weather
 from Countries c
  join weather w on c.country_id  = w.country_id 
   where day between '2019-11-01' and '2019-11-30'
    group by country_name)

select country_name,(case when avg_weather<=15 then 'Cold'
 when avg_weather>=25 then 'Hot' 
  else 'Warm' end)weather_type 
   from cte
