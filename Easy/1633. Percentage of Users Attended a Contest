Write an SQL query to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.

Return the result table ordered by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, order it by contest_id in ascending order.


select contest_id, round(count(*)*1.0/(select count(*)unique_users from users)*100, 2)percentage from users u 
right join register r on u.user_id = r.user_id
group by contest_id
order by round(count(*)*1.0/(select count(*)unique_users from users)*100, 2) desc, contest_id asc
