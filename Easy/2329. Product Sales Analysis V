Write an SQL query that reports the spending of each user.

Return the resulting table ordered by spending in descending order. In case of a tie, order them by user_id in ascending order.



select user_id, sum(quantity*price)spending from sales s
left join product p on s.product_id = p.product_id
group by user_id
order by sum(quantity*price) desc, user_id
