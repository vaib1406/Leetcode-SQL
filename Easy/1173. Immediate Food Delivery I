If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.
Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, rounded to 2 decimal places.


select round(100*sum(case when order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date then 1 else 0 end)*1.0/count(*),2)immediate_percentage from delivery
