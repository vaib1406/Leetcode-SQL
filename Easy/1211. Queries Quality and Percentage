We define query quality as:
The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.
We also define poor query percentage as:
The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write an SQL query to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.


with cte as
(select query_name, round((sum(1.0*rating/position))/count(*),2)quality, count(*)total_cnt
from queries
group by query_name)

select q.query_name,quality, round((1.0*sum(case when rating < 3 then 1 else 0 end)/total_cnt*100),2)poor_query_percentage from Queries q
join cte c on q.query_name = c.query_name
group by q.query_name,quality,total_cnt
