Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. 
Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is 'N'.

Write an SQL query to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.

with cte as
(select employee_id from employee
group by employee_id
having count(*)=1)

select e.employee_id,e.department_id from cte c
join employee e on c.employee_id = e.employee_id
union
select employee_id,department_id from employee
where primary_flag = 'Y'
