Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, 
their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.



select e1.employee_id from employees e1
left join employees e2 on e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id 
where e1.manager_id is not null and
e1.salary < '30000' and e2.employee_id is null
order by e1.employee_id
