There is a country with three schools, where each student is enrolled in exactly one school. The country is joining a competition and wants to select one student from each school to represent the country such that:

member_A is selected from SchoolA,
member_B is selected from SchoolB,
member_C is selected from SchoolC, and
The selected students' names and IDs are pairwise distinct (i.e. no two students share the same name, and no two students share the same ID).
Write an SQL query to find all the possible triplets representing the country under the given constraints.


select s1.student_name  member_A , s2.student_name member_B , s3.student_name member_C from schoolA s1
join SchoolB s2 on s1.student_id <> s2.student_id and s1.student_name <> s2.student_name 
join SchoolC s3 on s1.student_id <> s3.student_id and s1.student_name <> s3.student_name and
s3.student_id <> s2.student_id and s3.student_name <> s2.student_name
