Write an SQL query to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.
The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer

1st solution:-

SELECT TOP 1 customer_number 
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY count(order_number) DESC;

2nd solution:-

with cte as(select customer_number, count(*)cnt
from orders
group by customer_number)

select customer_number from cte
where cnt = (select max(cnt) from cte)
