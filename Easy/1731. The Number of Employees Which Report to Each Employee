For this problem, we will consider a manager an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.
Write an SQL query to report the ids and the names of all managers, the number of employees who report directly to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

select 

e1.employee_id, e1.name, count(*)reports_count, round((1.0*sum(e2.age)/count(*)),0)average_age 

from employees e1
join employees e2 on e1.employee_id = e2.reports_to
group by  e1.employee_id, e1.name
order by e1.employee_id
